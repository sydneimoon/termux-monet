[Termux-Monet](https://github.com/Juliocj7/termux-monet) is a unofficial, modified fork of [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app), an Android terminal application and Linux environment, with experimental features.
This project is developed on my spare time, for me to learn more about Android development. Dont expect consistency, professionality or stability.

Monet is only available on Android 12+ in lower versions will display a static, black and white Monet theme

Thanks for [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) for creating this incredible app!

### Phantom Process Killer

**NOTICE:**
> **Termux may be unstable on Android 12+.** Android OS will kill any (phantom) processes greater than 32 (limit is for all apps combined) and also kill any processes using excessive CPU. You may get `[Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter]` message in the terminal without actually exiting the shell process yourself. Check the related issue [#2366](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366), [issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/205156966), [gist with details](https://gist.github.com/agnostic-apollo/dc7e47991c512755ff26bd2d31e72ca8) and [this TLDR comment](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366#issuecomment-1009269410) on how to disable trimming of phantom processes.

#### Deactivation Instructions (ADB):
- On an ADB console, paste the following commands on the following order:
```
adb shell "/system/bin/device_config set_sync_disabled_for_tests persistent"
```
```
adb shell "/system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647"
```
```
adb shell settings put global settings_enable_monitor_phantom_procs false
```

#### Deactivation Instructions (ROOT):
- On Termux (or any Terminal Emulator), paste the following commands on the following order:
```
su -c /system/bin/device_config set_sync_disabled_for_tests persistent
```
```
su -c /system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647
```
```
su -c setprop persist.sys.fflag.override.settings_enable_monitor_phantom_procs false
```

#### Experimental Method (MAGISK)

- On a Rooted phone with Magisk installed, flash the following module:

    > [![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?message=LetTheGhostsOut.zip&logo=magisk&labelColor=5c5c5c&color=00af9c&logoColor=white&label=%20&style=for-the-badge)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HardcodedCat/termux-monet/master/ppr/PhantomProcessRetainer-main.zip)

- After that, `PhantomProcessKiller might be deactivated on every device boot.` Please make an [issue](https://github.com/HardcodedCat/termux-monet/issues) on this repo if the module didn't work for you.

#### Check if PhantomProcessKiller was Disabled (ROOT):
```
su -c /system/bin/dumpsys activity settings | grep max_phantom_processes
```
```
su -c /system/bin/device_config get activity_manager max_phantom_processes
```
- Both commands above should return `2147483647`

```
su -c getprop persist.sys.fflag.override.settings_enable_monitor_phantom_procs
```
- It should return "false"

***

### Nightly Builds

> Termux-Monet application can be obtained on **GitHub** either from [`GitHub Releases`](https://github.com/HardcodedCat/termux-monet/releases) for **stablier releases** or from [`GitHub Actions`](https://github.com/HardcodedCat/termux-monet/actions/workflows/debug_build.yml) for the latest **unstable releases**.

#### Releases (Stablier)
 - The APKs for `GitHub Releases` will be listed under `Assets` drop-down of a release. These are automatically attached when a new version is released.

#### Nightly (Unstable)
 - The APKs for `GitHub Actions` will be listed under `Artifacts` section of a workflow run. These are created for each commit/push done to the repository and can be used by users who don't want to wait for releases and want to try out the latest features immediately. Note that for seeing action workflows, you **need** to be [**logged into a `GitHub` account**](https://github.com/login) for the `Artifacts` links to be enabled/clickable. If you are using the [`GitHub` app](https://github.com/mobile), then make sure to open workflow link in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that has your GitHub account logged in since the in-app browser may not be logged in. 

**Security warning**: APK files on GitHub are signed with a test key that has been [shared with community](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks). This IS NOT an official developer key and everyone can use it to generate releases for own testing. Be very careful when using Termux GitHub builds obtained elsewhere except https://github.com/termux/termux-app. Everyone is able to use it to forge a malicious Termux update installable over the GitHub build. Think twice about installing Termux builds distributed via Telegram or other social media. If your device get caught by malware, we will not be able to help you.

The [test key](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks) shall not be used to impersonate @termux and can't be used for this anyway. This key is not trusted by us and it is quite easy to detect its use in user generated content.

### Debugging

You can help debug problems of the `Termux` app and its plugins by setting appropriate `logcat` `Log Level` in `Termux` app settings -> `<APP_NAME>` -> `Debugging` -> `Log Level` (Requires `Termux` app version `>= 0.118.0`). The `Log Level` defaults to `Normal` and log level `Verbose` currently logs additional information. Its best to revert log level to `Normal` after you have finished debugging since private data may otherwise be passed to `logcat` during normal operation and moreover, additional logging increases execution time.

The plugin apps **do not execute the commands themselves** but send execution intents to `Termux` app, which has its own log level which can be set in `Termux` app settings -> `Termux` -> `Debugging` -> `Log Level`. So you must set log level for both `Termux` and the respective plugin app settings to get all the info.

Once log levels have been set, you can run the `logcat` command in `Termux` app terminal to view the logs in realtime (`Ctrl+c` to stop) or use `logcat -d > logcat.txt` to take a dump of the log. You can also view the logs from a PC over `ADB`. For more information, check official android `logcat` guide [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat).

Moreover, users can generate termux files `stat` info and `logcat` dump automatically too with terminal's long hold options menu `More` -> `Report Issue` option and selecting `YES` in the prompt shown to add debug info. This can be helpful for reporting and debugging other issues. If the report generated is too large, then `Save To File` option in context menu (3 dots on top right) of `ReportActivity` can be used and the file viewed/shared instead.

Users must post complete report (optionally without sensitive info) when reporting issues. Issues opened with **(partial) screenshots of error reports** instead of text will likely be automatically closed/deleted.

##### Log Levels

- `Off` - Log nothing.
- `Normal` - Start logging error, warn and info messages and stacktraces.
- `Debug` - Start logging debug messages.
- `Verbose` - Start logging verbose messages.

### Forking

- Check [`TermuxConstants`](https://github.com/HardcodedCat/termux-monet/blob/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java) javadocs for instructions on what changes to make in the app to change package name.
- Keep targetSdk 28 to avoid login error `not exec("/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/login"): Permission denied`.
- You also need to recompile bootstrap zip for the new package name. Check [building bootstrap](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/For-maintainers#build-bootstrap-archives), [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/1983) and [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2081#issuecomment-865280111).
- Currently, not all plugins use `TermuxConstants` from `termux-shared` library and have hardcoded `com.termux` values and will need to be manually patched.
- If forking termux plugins, check [Forking and Local Development](https://github.com/HardcodedCat/termux-monet/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development) for info on how to use termux libraries for plugins.
- Enable GitHub actions and do any commit to build termux. e.g. upload a placeholder file.
- Create empty releases. You don't need to manually upload termux apks, GitHub Actions will do all the job for you.

### True italic fonts
> As described in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/2829, true italic fonts support can be enabled when placing an italic font in `~/.termux/font-italic.ttf`

***

### Dynamic Motd

> As described in [motds: add static motd back and use it as default instead of dynamic motd and add support for custom motd](https://github.com/termux/termux-tools/commit/6a0f5cc138c2c87fef91807fe0244e3531821d4c), in https://github.com/termux/termux-tools/pull/8, and in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/11250, Termux can now display both standard and dynamic motds.

> For using your own custom dynamic motd, place a `motd.sh` executable file at `~/.termux/`.

> To use the dynamic motd provided by the latest termux-tools package, run `ln -sf $PREFIX/etc/motd.sh ~/.termux/motd.sh`.

***

### Wallpaper support
> As described in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/3079, Wallpapers can be defined either by placing `background_landscape.jpeg` and `background.jpeg` on `.termux` folder or by selecting the option `Set background image` inside the terminal context menu, under "Appearance".
> Background image loading can also be enabled/disabled from settings. From Termux Settings -> Termux -> Termux Style -> Background Image.

> An wallpaper overlay color can be defined through `termux.properties`, by using the key `background-overlay-color=#COLOR`. Supported color formats are `#AARRGGBB` and `#RRGGBB`

***

### Displaying images

> As described in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/2973, Termux can display images and gifs using sixel and iterm2 protocols.

> For displaying images and gifs using `Sixel`, do `pkg install libsixel` and use `img2sixel image.png`

> For displaying images using `iTerm2`, download the [imgcat](https://iterm2.com/utilities/imgcat) script, and use it with the command `./imgcat image.png`

***

### Running termux from ADB
